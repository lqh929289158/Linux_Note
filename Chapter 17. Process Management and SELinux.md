# Chapter 17. Process Management and SELinux

# 1. What is Process?

In Linux, whenever an event is triggered, it will be defined as a process, and assign a **PID** to it. At the same time, the **authorities** will be bounded to the process according to the its **owner** and related configuration. Then, what the process can do is limited by its **autorities**.

## 1.1 Process and Program

Program: A binary **file** stored in storage device.
Process: A executing program loaded to **main memory** with a label **PID** and related **authorites, data, code** and so on.

The same program triggered by different users will become processes with different authorities.

### Child and Parent process

Child Process: process triggered by another process(Parent process).
Parent Process: A process which triggered another process(Child process).

Use `ps -l` to list all process.
The PID and PPID(Parent PID) will be listed.

### `fork` and `exec` the procedure of process call
We call Parent Process A and Chile Process B.
1. A(PID:x,Name:zzz)  `fork`-> TMP(PID:y, PPID:x, NAME:zzz)
2. A `exec qqq`-> B(PID:y, PPID:x, NAME:qqq)

### System/Network Service: Resident Process

The services always executing in the memory are called resident process, such as **crond**(scanning `/etc/crontab` per minute). They are also called **daemon**.

## 1.2 Multiple-User Multiple-Job Environment

In default, Linux has 7 login windows(Terminal)(6 command line and 1 GUI).Every terminal can be logged in by different users.

In Linux, it will never freeze! Because it can kill the dead process and restart it. What you need to do is switch to another termial by \[Alt\] + \[F1\]/\[F2\]... and `ps -aux` find the dead process and `kill` it!

How could we run many process simutaneously in single bash? Yes!
```
[root@www ~]# cp file1 file2 &
```
The `&` will execute the command in backend and you can start another sub-process.

# 2. Job Control

## 2.1 What is Job Control?

First, job control is a concept in one bash, where the processes are related to each other(a process tree?). So we can't manage bash of `tty2` from environment `tty1` by job control.

Second, **foreground** is the terminal you can see and interact. **Background** is a invisible environment where the processes are paused or executed.
> NOTE: Process in background **can't interact with users** and **can't be terminated by \[Ctrl\] + \[c\]**.

In summary:
- Job Control is about the sub-processes generated by your **bash**.(Limited in a bash)
- Foreground: Environment where you can control and execute commands.
- Background: Environment where processes are executed automatically. Can't be terminated by \[Ctrl\]+\[c\] but you can use bg/fg to call them.
- Processes run in the background can not wait for the input from foreground.
